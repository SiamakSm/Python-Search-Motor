It's a lot of work but I was able to learn an insane amount quickly. I was wondering if anyone wanted help getting going on Python?  Im a teacher professionally and think the way I learned was really accelerated. I was going to offer it to others if anyone needs help.   Let me know! ;Reddit;140

3;Stop building UI frameworks in Python;PastPicture;2025-09-08;https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nbkych/stop_building_ui_frameworks_in_python/;7 years back when I started coding, I used Tkinter. Then PyQt.   I spent some good 2 weeks debating if I should learn Kivy or Java for building an Android app.  Then we've got modern ones: FastUI by Pydantic, NiceGUI (amazing project, it's the closest bet).  Python is great for a lot of things. Just stop abusing it by building (or trying to) UI with it.   Even if you ship something you'll wake up in mid of night thinking of all the weird scenarios, convincing yourself to go back to sleep since you'll find a workaround like last time.   Why I am saying this: Because I've tried it all. I've tried every possible way to avoid JavaScript and keep building UIs with Python.  I've contributed to some really popular UI libraries in Python, tried inventing one back in Tkinter days.   I finally caved in and I now build UI with JavaScript, and I'm happier person now. I feel more human.;Reddit;342

20;ePython: An implementation of Python for the many-core Epiphany coprocessor;Nick Brown;2020-10-28;http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14827v1;The Epiphany is a many-core, low power, low on-chip memory architecture and one can very cheaply gain access to a number of parallel cores which is beneficial for HPC education and prototyping. The very low power nature of these architectures also means that there is potential for their use in future HPC machines, however there is a high barrier to entry in programming them due to the associated complexities and immaturity of supporting tools.   In this paper we present our work on ePython, a subset of Python for the Epiphany and similar many-core co-processors. Due to the limited on-chip memory per core we have developed a new Python interpreter and this, combined with additional support for parallelism, has meant that novices can take advantage of Python to very quickly write parallel codes on the Epiphany and explore concepts of HPC using a smaller scale parallel machine. The high level nature of Python opens up new possibilities on the Epiphany, we examine a computationally intensive Gauss-Seidel code from the programmability and performance perspective, discuss running Python hybrid on both the host CPU and Epiphany, and interoperability between a full Python interpreter on the CPU and ePython on the Epiphany. The result of this work is support for developing Python on the Epiphany, which can be applied to other similar architectures, that the community have already started to adopt and use to explore concepts of parallelism and HPC.;Arxiv;Nick Brown
21;Social Network Analysis: From Graph Theory to Applications with Python;Dmitri Goldenberg;2021-02-05;http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10014v1;Social network analysis is the process of investigating social structures through the use of networks and graph theory. It combines a variety of techniques for analyzing the structure of social networks as well as theories that aim at explaining the underlying dynamics and patterns observed in these structures. It is an inherently interdisciplinary field which originally emerged from the fields of social psychology, statistics and graph theory. This talk will covers the theory of social network analysis, with a short introduction to graph theory and information spread. Then we will deep dive into Python code with NetworkX to get a better understanding of the network components, followed-up by constructing and implying social networks from real Pandas and textual datasets. Finally we will go over code examples of practical use-cases such as visualization with matplotlib, social-centrality analysis and influence maximization for information spread.;Arxiv;Dmitri Goldenberg
22;atoMEC: An open-source average-atom Python code;Timothy J. Callow;2022-06-02;http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01074v2;Average-atom models are an important tool in studying matter under extreme conditions, such as those conditions experienced in planetary cores, brown and white dwarfs, and during inertial confinement fusion. In the right context, average-atom models can yield results with similar accuracy to simulations which require orders of magnitude more computing time, and thus can greatly reduce financial and environmental costs. Unfortunately, due to the wide range of possible models and approximations, and the lack of open-source codes, average-atom models can at times appear inaccessible. In this paper, we present our open-source average-atom code, atoMEC. We explain the aims and structure of atoMEC to illuminate the different stages and options in an average-atom calculation, and to facilitate community contributions. We also discuss the use of various open-source Python packages in atoMEC, which have expedited its development.;Arxiv;Timothy J. Callow|Daniel Kotik|Eli Kraisler|Attila Cangi

24;Python for education: permutations;Andrzej Kapanowski;2013-07-26;http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7042v1;Python implementation of permutations is presented. Three classes are introduced: Perm for permutations, Group for permutation groups, and PermError to report any errors for both classes. The class Perm is based on Python dictionaries and utilize cycle notation. The methods of calculation for the perm order, parity, ranking and unranking are given. A random permutation generation is also shown. The class Group is very simple and it is also based on dictionaries. It is mainly the presentation of the permutation groups interface with methods for the group order, subgroups (normalizer, centralizer, center, stabilizer), orbits, and several tests. The corresponding Python code is contained in the modules perms and groups.;Arxiv;Andrzej Kapanowski
25;Weighted graph algorithms with Python;A. Kapanowski;2015-04-29;http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07828v1;Python implementation of selected weighted graph algorithms is presented. The minimal graph interface is defined together with several classes implementing this interface. Graph nodes can be any hashable Python objects. Directed edges are instances of the Edge class. Graphs are instances of the Graph class. It is based on the adjacency-list representation, but with fast lookup of nodes and neighbors (dict-of-dict structure). Other implementations of this class are also possible.   In this work, many algorithms are implemented using a unified approach. There are separate classes and modules devoted to different algorithms. Three algorithms for finding a minimum spanning tree are implemented: the Boruvka's algorithm, the Prim's algorithm (three implementations), and the Kruskal's algorithm. Three algorithms for solving the single-source shortest path problem are implemented: the dag shortest path algorithm, the Bellman-Ford algorithm, and the Dijkstra's algorithm (two implementations). Two algorithms for solving all-pairs shortest path problem are implemented: the Floyd-Warshall algorithm and the Johnson's algorithm.   All algorithms were tested by means of the unittest module, the Python unit testing framework. Additional computer experiments were done in order to compare real and theoretical computational complexity. The source code is available from the public GitHub repository.;Arxiv;A. Kapanowski|Ł.

Our module does not rely on WCS information and instead matches 3-point asterisms (triangles) on the images to find the most accurate linear transformation between the two. It is especially useful in the context of aligning images prior to stacking or performing difference image analysis. Astroalign can match images of different point-spread functions, seeing, and atmospheric conditions.;Arxiv;Martin Beroiz|Juan B. Cabral|Bruno Sanchez
29;Performance of Python runtimes on a non-numeric scientific code;Riccardo Murri;2014-04-25;http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6388v2;"The Python library FatGHol FatGHoL used in Murri2012 to reckon the rational homology of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces is an example of a non-numeric scientific code: most of the processing it does is generating graphs (represented by complex Python objects) and computing their isomorphisms (a triple of Python lists; again a nested data structure). These operations are repeated many times over: for example, the spaces and are triangulated by 4'583'322 and 747'664 graphs, respectively. This is an opportunity for every Python runtime to prove its strength in optimization. The purpose of this experiment was to assess the maturity of alternative Python runtimes, in terms of: compatibility with the language as implemented in CPython 2.7, and performance speedup. This paper compares the results and experiences from running FatGHol with different Python runtimes: CPython 2.7.5, PyPy 2.1, Cython 0.19, Numba 0.11, Nuitka 0.4.4 and Falcon.";Arxiv;Riccardo Murri

Although the C++ interfaces of DUNE-FEM-DG are highly flexible and customizable, a solid knowledge of C++ is necessary to make use of this powerful tool. With this work easier user interfaces based on Python and the Unified Form Language are provided to open DUNE-FEM-DG for a broader audience. The Python interfaces are demonstrated for both parabolic and first order hyperbolic PDEs.;Arxiv;Andreas Dedner|Robert Klöfkorn
32;Data Engineering for HPC with Python;Vibhatha Abeykoon;2020-10-13;http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06312v1;Data engineering is becoming an increasingly important part of scientific discoveries with the adoption of deep learning and machine learning. Data engineering deals with a variety of data formats, storage, data extraction, transformation, and data movements. One goal of data engineering is to transform data from original data to vector/matrix/tensor formats accepted by deep learning and machine learning applications. There are many structures such as tables, graphs, and trees to represent data in these data engineering phases. Among them, tables are a versatile and commonly used format to load and process data. In this paper, we present a distributed Python API based on table abstraction for representing and processing data. Unlike existing state-of-the-art data engineering tools written purely in Python, our solution adopts high performance compute kernels in C++, with an in-memory table representation with Cython-based Python bindings. In the core system, we use MPI for distributed memory computations with a data-parallel approach for processing large datasets in HPC clusters.;Arxiv;Vibhatha Abeykoon|Niranda Perera|Chathura Widanage|Supun Kamburugamuve|Thejaka Amila Kanewala|Hasara Maithree|Pulasthi Wickramasinghe|Ahmet Uyar|Geoffrey Fox

35;SPySort: Neuronal Spike Sorting with Python;Christophe Pouzat;2014-12-19;http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6383v1;Extracellular recordings with multi-electrode arrays is one of the basic tools of contemporary neuroscience. These recordings are mostly used to monitor the activities, understood as sequences of emitted action potentials, of many individual neurons. But the raw data produced by extracellular recordings are most commonly a mixture of activities from several neurons. In order to get the activities of the individual contributing neurons, a pre-processing step called spike sorting is required. We present here a pure Python implementation of a well tested spike sorting procedure. The latter was designed in a modular way in order to favour a smooth transition from an interactive sorting, for instance with IPython, to an automatic one. Surprisingly enough - or sadly enough, depending on one's view point -, recoding our now 15 years old procedure into Python was the occasion of major methodological improvements.;Arxiv;Christophe Pouzat|Georgios Is.

36;Exponential Integrators for Phase-Field Equations using Pseudo-spectral Methods: A Python Implementation;Elvis do A. Soares;2023-05-15;http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08998v1;In this paper, we implement exponential integrators, specifically Integrating Factor (IF) and Exponential Time Differencing (ETD) methods, using pseudo-spectral techniques to solve phase-field equations within a Python framework. These exponential integrators have showcased robust performance and accuracy when addressing stiff nonlinear partial differential equations. We compare these integrators to the well-known implicit-explicit (IMEX) Euler integrators used in phase-field modeling. The synergy between pseudo-spectral techniques and exponential integrators yields significant benefits for modeling intricate systems governed by phase-field dynamics, such as solidification processes and pattern formation. Our comprehensive Python implementation illustrates the effectiveness of this combined approach in solving phase-field model equations. The results obtained from this implementation highlight the accuracy and computational advantages of the ETD method compared to other numerical techniques.;Arxiv;Elvis do A. Soares|Amaro G.

38;AutoParallel: A Python module for automatic parallelization and distributed execution of affine loop nests;Cristian Ramon-Cortes;2018-10-26;http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11268v1;The last improvements in programming languages, programming models, and frameworks have focused on abstracting the users from many programming issues. Among others, recent programming frameworks include simpler syntax, automatic memory management and garbage collection, which simplifies code re-usage through library packages, and easily configurable tools for deployment. For instance, Python has risen to the top of the list of the programming languages due to the simplicity of its syntax, while still achieving a good performance even being an interpreted language. Moreover, the community has helped to develop a large number of libraries and modules, tuning them to obtain great performance.   However, there is still room for improvement when preventing users from dealing directly with distributed and parallel computing issues. This paper proposes and evaluates AutoParallel, a Python module to automatically find an appropriate task-based parallelization of affine loop nests to execute them in parallel in a distributed computing infrastructure. This parallelization can also include the building of data blocks to increase task granularity in order to achieve a good execution performance. Moreover, AutoParallel is based on sequential programming and only contains a small annotation in the form of a Python decorator so that anyone with little programming skills can scale up an application to hundreds of cores.;Arxiv;Cristian Ramon-Cortes|Ramon Amela|Jorge Ejarque|Philippe Clauss|Rosa M.
