That was** [spydadthrowaway](https://www.reddit.com/user/spydadthrowaway/). He posted in r/AmItheAsshole  Thanks to u/Direct-Caterpillar77 for the rec!  # Do NOT Comment on Original Posts. This is an older post.  **Mood Spoiler:** >!happy ending!<  **Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gtylfd/aita_for_installing_a_keylogger_in_my_sons/)**: May 31, 2020**  I'm a single dad, 43 years old. Computer programmer. My son, let's call him Jack, is 17 years old. Jack's mom died when he was 10, but thankfully we both handled our grief together quite well.  When Jack got his first laptop, five years ago, I took my time explaining how the internet worked, the dangers, etc. I allowed him to create a social media account, as long as he allowed me to check on it whenever I wanted, which was a privilege I made use of a few times until he turned 15 and I realized I could trust him, having never asked for it since then. He allowed me to know where he stored his account passwords just in case, but I never really looked for them, so his social media and computer activity have been a complete mystery to me in the last couple of years.  However, I was always fearful he would try to hide something or get into something dangerous, so I installed a keylogger just in case, always thinking about his safety. I never had to use it and, the more I watched him grow up, I eventually I realized I would never really use it, but I never bothered to remove it.  My sister and I were talking about this in a casual conversation regarding privacy and privacy apps and my niece overheard us (they were born the same year). She got offended I would do such a thing, claiming it was a horrible invasion of Jack's privacy, and that I should be ashamed, and the only reason she hasn't told my son was because my sister told her she'd ground her for meddling in my parenting.  So, reddit. AITA for having installed a keylogger even though I never had to use it?  ***Top Comments:***  **xfatalerror:** YTA. no different than a mom threatening to read her teenage girls diary. your child is almost an adult now, so there is no need to threaten invasion of his privacy. this is a violation of trust between you and your son. even if you dont use the key logger, its still hanging over his head for you to use against him.  >**sunnyfel:** I don't understand your comment.   He installed it when his son was 12. The internet is full of creeps so of course as a parent you should monitor what is going on during the use.   The only fault I see and that's what you said also, is that he should have taken it out when he became more mature.   Also, he stated that he never used it. And the son isn't aware. So it isn't like he is actually threatening to breach his privacy.   He should definitely take it out asap though.   Edit : NAH but YWBTA if you didn't talk to your son asap and uninstall it  **lovesbigpolar:** INFO did you install the keylogger when he was 11?  If you installed it beck then, NTA. Tell your son and uninstall it. You were doing it for his safety. The number of abductions due to predators on the internet is scary enough and most parents don't know anything or have a way to look for info.  If you did it much more recently, YTA. Definitely tell your son, apologize and uninstall it.  >**OOP:** I installed it when he was 12, yes. I honestly never removed it because recently I had kind of forgotten about it until this conversation with my sister, and since he is getting a new laptop in a few weeks anyway, I didn't want to bother with it.  **NorbearWrangler:** Since you put it on there when he was 12 and you don’t use it, NTA.  Your niece may well decide it’s worth the risk and tell him anyway, which could get really ugly.  So tell your son the truth - you put it on there when he was 12, you don’t use it, but you never got around to uninstalling it. Apologize for that. Offer him a choice - you can uninstall it, he can uninstall it, or he can leave it there since he’s getting a new laptop anyway. If there’s a way for him to confirm the last time the program was accessed, tell him how.  This is the key part: teach him how to check for spyware, malware, key loggers, etc. Don’t give yourself admin privileges on his new laptop.  This is a really good chance for you to model how to maturely apologize and make amends.  ***OOP is voted YTA, but comments are mixed***  **Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hdzji1/update_aita_for_installing_a_keylogger_in_my_sons/)**: June 22, 2020 (22 days later)**  So... this blew up. I read all the comments and I really appreciate the insight on both sides, which I will not comment nor give my opinion on since a veredict is a veredict. Each person is entitled to their own opinion, but I want you to know that I took into consideration all of them, even with the majority considering me an asshole.  It took me two days of pondering, especially with the threat of my niece telling Jack everything, before I sat him down and talked to him. I came out clean, told him about the keylogger, then explained to him what it did, why I did it, and how it worked. Jack believed me when I told him I had never looked at anything. We both shared a laugh when he told me he believed me because a)I am a complete airhead so it is perfectly believable I forgot about the keylogger for years and b) he admitted to having watched porn, and he is sure I would have commented on it, because both my sister and I both openly dislike the porn industry.  He told me he isn't mad at me, that he's glad I told him about it now instead of, say, twenty years from now, and that he would have done the same thing in my situation, keylogger and everything. I showed him how to remove it and how to look for it in further devices, and we had a look at a few laptops together. I ended up buying him a new one and helped him set it up (yes, no keyloggers). He let me know the password he used, in case it was necessary.  Regarding my niece, she didn't tell him anything, but my sister and I had a conversation with them at the same time over dinner. My niece used the same argument as many of you did, with it being the same as reading a diary, and it was one that both my sister and I agreed with. My sister was admittedly much stricter with her daughter than I was with my son, since she checked her texts and Instagram/Facebook/Whatsapp messages, but she admitted it was because of her massive fear that everything that is uploaded to the internet lasts forever, and she was afraid of things like nudes being leaked, undesired contact with bad people, cyberbullying or any possible hurtful things. They ended up agreeing to disagreeing and my sister promised to start trusting my niece more with these things, since she knows she won't be able to do anything about it once she turns eighteen.  I want to thank you all for the feedback and for your suggestions over how I should handle this, even the ones who called me an asshole. I felt like I owed you this update.;Reddit;372

After configuring their 2FA, I had them sign into their assigned laptop. While the profile loads, usually about 60 seconds on first login, I typically use that time to go over a few policies, domain links, where to submit a ticket, and explain our phishing campaign.  I do all of this from my computer to save time.  As soon as he signed in, I said, ""Let's give your profile a moment to load and I'll show you a few things in our environment.""   Before I could continue, he cut me off in a somewhat arrogant tone with, ""Umm, I'm Gen Z. I know how to use computers.""  I replied, ""Of course. I just need to show you a few things specific to our environment.  Do you know what a phishing email is?""  He looked at me like a deer in headlights.   ""A what?""   ""A phishing email.""   ""I don't know what that is.""  No problem. I gave him a quick rundown on what phishing looks like, how our simulator works, and how to report suspicious emails. He wasn't rude, but he definitely looked at me like I was some out-of-touch boomer trying to mansplain the internet while he sipped his Starbucks Frappuccino. (To be honest though, I do have a grey beard but I'm no where near a boomer's age.  I'm Gen X)  The funny part is, I could have just handed him the laptop with no explanation. But without that introduction, he almost certainly would have clicked one of the simulated emails in the first few days, which automatically enrolls users in mandatory extended training.  Or even worse, a real threat.  And guess who that reflects on? Us, for ""not informing the user.""  I have all users sign an inventory sheet that also states we went over a brief phishing explanation so they can't ever say we didn't inform them.  I’m just venting a bit about how people can sometimes come across as assuming or defensive when IT is simply trying to do its job.  Kind of like we're speaking down to them.

The system presented here is a vision-based system for detection of long voluntary eye blinks and interpretation of blink patterns for communication between man and machine. This system replaces the mouse with the human face as a new way to interact with the computer. Facial features (nose tip and eyes) are detected and tracked in realtime to use their actions as mouse events. The coordinates and movement of the nose tip in the live video feed are translated to become the coordinates and movement of the mouse pointer on the application. The left or right eye blinks fire left or right mouse click events. The system works with inexpensive USB cameras and runs at a frame rate of 30 frames per second.;Arxiv;S. Sumathi|S. K. Srivatsa|M.

The present paper contains a soundness and completeness proof for the deductive system CL3 which axiomatizes the most basic first-order fragment of computability logic called the finite-depth, elementary-base fragment. Among the potential application areas for this result are the theory of interactive computation, constructive applied theories, knowledgebase systems, systems for resource-bound planning and action.

23;A Computational Algorithm based on Empirical Analysis, that Composes Sanskrit Poetry;Rama N.;2010-03-07;http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1455v1;Poetry-writing in Sanskrit is riddled with problems for even those who know the language well. This is so because the rules that govern Sanskrit prosody are numerous and stringent. We propose a computational algorithm that converts prose given as E-text into poetry in accordance with the metrical rules of Sanskrit prosody, simultaneously taking care to ensure that sandhi or euphonic conjunction, which is compulsory in verse, is handled. The algorithm is considerably speeded up by a novel method of reducing the target search database. The algorithm further gives suggestions to the poet in case what he/she has given as the input prose is impossible to fit into any allowed metrical format. There is also an interactive component of the algorithm by which the algorithm interacts with the poet to resolve ambiguities. In addition, this unique work, which provides a solution to a problem that has never been addressed before, provides a simple yet effective speech recognition interface that would help the visually impaired dictate words in E-text, which is in turn versified by our Poetry Composer Engine.;Arxiv;Rama N.|Meenakshi Lakshmanan
24;Semantic Edge Computing and Semantic Communications in 6G Networks: A Unifying Survey and Research Challenges;Milin Zhang;2024-11-27;http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18199v3;Semantic Edge Computing (SEC) and Semantic Communications (SemComs) have been proposed as viable approaches to achieve real-time edge-enabled intelligence in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. On one hand, SemCom leverages the strength of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to encode and communicate the semantic information only, while making it robust to channel distortions by compensating for wireless effects. Ultimately, this leads to an improvement in the communication efficiency. On the other hand, SEC has leveraged distributed DNNs to divide the computation of a DNN across different devices based on their computational and networking constraints. Although significant progress has been made in both fields, the literature lacks a systematic view to connect both fields. In this work, we fulfill the current gap by unifying the SEC and SemCom fields. We summarize the research problems in these two fields and provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art with a focus on their technical strengths and challenges.;Arxiv;Milin Zhang|Mohammad Abdi|Venkat R.

25;TACHYON: Efficient Shared Memory Parallel Computation of Extremum Graphs;Abhijath Ande;2023-03-05;http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02724v1;The extremum graph is a succinct representation of the Morse decomposition of a scalar field. It has increasingly become a useful data structure that supports topological feature directed visualization of 2D / 3D scalar fields, and enables dimensionality reduction together with exploratory analysis of high dimensional scalar fields. Current methods that employ the extremum graph compute it either using a simple sequential algorithm for computing the Morse decomposition or by computing the more detailed Morse-Smale complex. Both approaches are typically limited to two and three dimensional scalar fields. We describe a GPU-CPU hybrid parallel algorithm for computing the extremum graph of scalar fields in all dimensions. The proposed shared memory algorithm utilizes both fine grained parallelism and task parallelism to achieve efficiency. An open source software library, TACHYON, that implements the algorithm exhibits superior performance and good scaling behavior.;Arxiv;Abhijath Ande|Varshini Subhash|Vijay Natarajan
26;Security Policies as Membranes in Systems for Global Computing;Daniele Gorla;2005-06-14;http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0506061v5;We propose a simple global computing framework, whose main concern is code migration. Systems are structured in sites, and each site is divided into two parts: a computing body, and a membrane, which regulates the interactions between the computing body and the external environment. More precisely, membranes are filters which control access to the associated site, and they also rely on the well-established notion of trust between sites. We develop a basic theory to express and enforce security policies via membranes. Initially, these only control the actions incoming agents intend to perform locally. We then adapt the basic theory to encompass more sophisticated policies, where the number of actions an agent wants to perform, and also their order, are considered.;Arxiv;Daniele Gorla|Matthew Hennessy|Vladimiro Sassone
27;On Communication Protocols that Compute Almost Privately;Marco Comi;2011-02-07;http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1443v3;"A traditionally desired goal when designing auction mechanisms is incentive compatibility, i.e., ensuring that bidders fare best by truthfully reporting their preferences. A complementary goal, which has, thus far, received significantly less attention, is to preserve privacy, i.e., to ensure that bidders reveal no more information than necessary. We further investigate and generalize the approximate privacy model for two-party communication recently introduced by Feigenbaum et al.[8]. We explore the privacy properties of a natural class of communication protocols that we refer to as ""dissection protocols"". Dissection protocols include, among others, the bisection auction in [9,10] and the bisection protocol for the millionaires problem in [8]. Informally, in a dissection protocol the communicating parties are restricted to answering simple questions of the form ""Is your input between the values αand β(under a predefined order over the possible inputs)?"".   We prove that for a large class of functions, called tiling functions, which include the 2nd-price Vickrey auction, there always exists a dissection protocol that provides a constant average-case privacy approximation ratio for uniform or ""almost uniform"" probability distributions over inputs. To establish this result we present an interesting connection between the approximate privacy framework and basic concepts in computational geometry. We show that such a good privacy approximation ratio for tiling functions does not, in general, exist in the worst case. We also discuss extensions of the basic setup to more than two parties and to non-tiling functions, and provide calculations of privacy approximation ratios for two functions of interest.";Arxiv;Marco Comi|Bhaskar DasGupta|Michael Schapira|Venkatakumar Srinivasan

Our main result is an online algorithm that, given a word $w$ of length $n$ over an alphabet of cardinality $σ$ and a Parikh vector $\mathcal{P}$, returns all the abelian runs of period $\mathcal{P}$ in $w$ in time $O(n)$ and space $O(σ+p)$, where $p$ is the norm of $\mathcal{P}$, i.e., the sum of its components. We also present an online algorithm that computes all the abelian runs with periods of norm $p$ in $w$ in time $O(np)$, for any given norm $p$. Finally, we give an $O(n^2)$-time offline randomized algorithm for computing all the abelian runs of $w$. Its deterministic counterpart runs in $O(n^2\logσ)$ time.;Arxiv;Gabriele Fici|Tomasz Kociumaka|Thierry Lecroq|Arnaud Lefebvre|Elise Prieur-Gaston
29;A Structural Approach to Reversible Computation;Samson Abramsky;2011-11-30;http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.7154v1;Reversibility is a key issue in the interface between computation and physics, and of growing importance as miniaturization progresses towards its physical limits. Most foundational work on reversible computing to date has focussed on simulations of low-level machine models. By contrast, we develop a more structural approach. We show how high-level functional programs can be mapped compositionally (i.e. in a syntax-directed fashion) into a simple kind of automata which are immediately seen to be reversible. The size of the automaton is linear in the size of the functional term. In mathematical terms, we are building a concrete model of functional computation. This construction stems directly from ideas arising in Geometry of Interaction and Linear Logic---but can be understood without any knowledge of these topics. In fact, it serves as an excellent introduction to them. At the same time, an interesting logical delineation between reversible and irreversible forms of computation emerges from our analysis.;Arxiv;Samson Abramsky
30;Type-based Self-stabilisation for Computational Fields;Ferruccio Damiani;2015-09-18;http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05659v2;Emerging network scenarios require the development of solid large-scale situated systems. Unfortunately, the diffusion/aggregation computational processes therein often introduce a source of complexity that hampers predictability of the overall system behaviour. Computational fields have been introduced to help engineering such systems: they are spatially distributed data structures designed to adapt their shape to the topology of the underlying (mobile) network and to the events occurring in it, with notable applications to pervasive computing, sensor networks, and mobile robots. To assure behavioural correctness, namely, correspondence of micro-level specification (single device behaviour) with macro-level behaviour (resulting global spatial pattern), we investigate the issue of self-stabilisation for computational fields. We present a tiny, expressive, and type-sound calculus of computational fields, and define sufficient conditions for self-stabilisation, defined as the ability to react to changes in the environment finding a new stable state in finite time. A type-based approach is used to provide a correct checking procedure for self-stabilisation.;Arxiv;Ferruccio Damiani|Mirko Viroli
31;FRaGenLP: A Generator of Random Linear Programming Problems for Cluster Computing Systems;Leonid B. Sokolinsky;2021-05-18;http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10384v1;The article presents and evaluates a scalable FRaGenLP algorithm for generating random linear programming problems of large dimension $n$ on cluster computing systems. To ensure the consistency of the problem and the boundedness of the feasible region, the constraint system includes $2n+1$ standard inequalities, called support inequalities. New random inequalities are generated and added to the system in a manner that ensures the consistency of the constraints. Furthermore, the algorithm uses two likeness metrics to prevent the addition of a new random inequality that is similar to one already present in the constraint system. The algorithm also rejects random inequalities that cannot affect the solution of the linear programming problem bounded by the support inequalities. The parallel implementation of the FRaGenLP algorithm is performed in C++ through the parallel BSF-skeleton, which encapsulates all aspects related to the MPI-based parallelization of the program. We provide the results of large-scale computational experiments on a cluster computing system to study the scalability of the FRaGenLP algorithm.;Arxiv;Leonid B. Sokolinsky|Irina M. Sokolinskaya
32;Relational Parametricity for Computational Effects;Rasmus Ejlers Møgelberg;2009-06-30;http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.5488v2;According to Strachey, a polymorphic program is parametric if it applies a uniform algorithm independently of the type instantiations at which it is applied. The notion of relational parametricity, introduced by Reynolds, is one possible mathematical formulation of this idea. Relational parametricity provides a powerful tool for establishing data abstraction properties, proving equivalences of datatypes, and establishing equalities of programs. Such properties have been well studied in a pure functional setting. Many programs, however, exhibit computational effects, and are not accounted for by the standard theory of relational parametricity. In this paper, we develop a foundational framework for extending the notion of relational parametricity to programming languages with effects.;Arxiv;Rasmus Ejlers Møgelberg|Alex Simpson
33;Preliminary study on artificial intelligence methods for cybersecurity threat detection in computer networks based on raw data packets;Aleksander Ogonowski;2024-07-24;http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17339v2;Most of the intrusion detection methods in computer networks are based on traffic flow characteristics. However, this approach may not fully exploit the potential of deep learning algorithms to directly extract features and patterns from raw packets. Moreover, it impedes real-time monitoring due to the necessity of waiting for the processing pipeline to complete and introduces dependencies on additional software components.   In this paper, we investigate deep learning methodologies capable of detecting attacks in real-time directly from raw packet data within network traffic. We propose a novel approach where packets are stacked into windows and separately recognised, with a 2D image representation suitable for processing with computer vision models. Our investigation utilizes the CIC IDS-2017 dataset, which includes both benign traffic and prevalent real-world attacks, providing a comprehensive foundation for our research.;Arxiv;Aleksander Ogonowski|Michał Żebrowski|Arkadiusz Ćwiek|Tobiasz Jarosiewicz|Konrad Klimaszewski|Adam Padee|Piotr Wasiuk|Michał Wójcik

This computing approach relies on a number of existing technologies, such as Web2.0, virtualization, Service oriented architecture SOA, Web services,etc.Cloud computing is growing rapidly and becoming an adoptable technology for the organizations especially education institutes, with its dynamic scalability and usage of virtualized resources as a service through the Internet.Today, eLearning is also becoming a very popular and powerful trend.However,in traditional web based eLearning systems,building and maintenance are located onsite in institutions or enterprises, which cause lot of problems to appear such as lacking the support of underlying infrastructure, which can dynamically allocate the needed calculation and storage resources for eLearning systems.As the need for e learning is increasing continuously and its necessary for eLearning systems to keep pace with the right technology needed for development and improvement.However, todays technologies such as Web 2.0, Cloud, etc.enable to build more successful and effective educational environment,that provide collaboration and interaction in eLearning environments.The challenge is to use and integrate these technologies in order to construct tools that allow the best possible learning results.Cloud computing and Web 2.0 are two areas that are starting to strongly effect how the development,deployment and usage of eLearning application.This paper presents the benefits of using cloud computing with the integration of Web 2.0 collaboration technologies in eLearning environment.;Arxiv;Rasha Fouad AlCattan
36;Automatic Differentiation With Higher Infinitesimals, or Computational Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis in Weil Algebra;Hiromi Ishii;2021-06-27;http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14153v2;"We propose an algorithm to compute the $C^\infty$-ring structure of arbitrary Weil algebra. It allows us to do some analysis with higher infinitesimals numerically and symbolically. To that end, we first give a brief description of the (Forward-mode) automatic differentiation (AD) in terms of $C^\infty$-rings. The notion of a $C^\infty$-ring was introduced by Lawvere and used as the fundamental building block of smooth infinitesimal analysis and synthetic differential geometry. We argue that interpreting AD in terms of $C^\infty$-rings gives us a unifying theoretical framework and modular ways to express multivariate partial derivatives. In particular, we can ""package"" higher-order Forward-mode AD as a Weil algebra, and take tensor products to compose them to achieve multivariate higher-order AD. The algorithms in the present paper can also be used for a pedagogical purpose in learning and studying smooth infinitesimal analysis as well.";Arxiv;Hiromi Ishii
37;Improved 3-Dimensional Security in Cloud Computing;Sagar Tirodkar;2014-04-07;http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1836v1;Cloud computing is a trending technology in the field of Information Technology as it allows sharing of resources over a network. The reason Cloud computing gained traction so rapidly was because of its performance, availability and low cost among other features. Besides these features, companies are still refraining from binding their business with cloud computing due to the fear of data leakage. The focus of this paper is on the problem of data leakage. It proposes a framework which works in two phases. The first phase consists of data encryption and classification which is performed before storing the data. In this phase, the client may want to encrypt his data prior to uploading. After encryption, data is classified using three parameters namely Confidentiality [C], Integrity [I] and Availability [A]. With the help of proposed algorithm, criticality rating (Cr) of the data is calculated. According to the Cr, security will be provided on the basis of the 3 Dimensions proposed in this paper. The second phase consists of data retrieval by the client. As per the concept of 3D, users who want to access their data need to be authenticated, to avoid data from being compromised. Before every access to data, the users identity is verified for authorization. After the user is authorized for data access, if the data is encrypted, the user can decrypt the same.;Arxiv;Sagar Tirodkar|Yazad Baldawala|Sagar Ulane|Ashok Jori
38;A Secure Multi-Party Computation Protocol for Malicious Computation Prevention for preserving privacy during Data Mining;Dr. Durgesh Kumar Mishra;2009-08-07;http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0994v1;"Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC) allows parties with similar background to compute results upon their private data, minimizing the threat of disclosure. The exponential increase in sensitive data that needs to be passed upon networked computers and the stupendous growth of internet has precipitated vast opportunities for cooperative computation, where parties come together to facilitate computations and draw out conclusions that are mutually beneficial; at the same time aspiring to keep their private data secure. These computations are generally required to be done between competitors, who are obviously weary of each-others intentions. SMC caters not only to the needs of such parties but also provides plausible solutions to individual organizations for problems like privacy-preserving database query, privacy-preserving scientific computations, privacy-preserving intrusion detection and privacy-preserving data mining. This paper is an extension to a previously proposed protocol Encrytpo_Random, which presented a plain sailing yet effective approach to SMC and also put forward an aptly crafted architecture, whereby such an efficient protocol, involving the parties that have come forward for joint-computations and the third party who undertakes such computations, can be developed. Through this extended work an attempt has been made to further strengthen the existing protocol thus paving the way for a more secure multi-party computational process.";Arxiv;Dr. Durgesh Kumar Mishra|Neha Koria|Nikhil Kapoor|Ravish Bahety
39;Computation of Pommaret Bases Using Syzygies;Bentolhoda Binaei;2018-09-28;http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10971v1;We investigate the application of syzygies for efficiently computing (finite) Pommaret bases. For this purpose, we first describe a non-trivial variant of Gerdt's algorithm to construct an involutive basis for the input ideal as well as an involutive basis for the syzygy module of the output basis. Then we apply this new algorithm in the context of Seiler's method to transform a given ideal into quasi stable position to ensure the existence of a finite Pommaret basis. This new approach allows us to avoid superfluous reductions in the iterative computation of Janet bases required by this method. We conclude the paper by proposing an involutive variant of the signature based algorithm of Gao et al. to compute simultaneously a Grobner basis for a given ideal and for the syzygy module of the input basis. All the presented algorithms have been implemented in Maple and their performance is evaluated via a set of benchmark ideals.;Arxiv;Bentolhoda Binaei|Amir Hashemi|Werner M. Seiler
